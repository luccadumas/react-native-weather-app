<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is intended to help hundreds of developers who, like me, need an APP that is really simple to show the weather of the city I'm in, also showing the weather forecast for the week.

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves problems while helping others.
* You should not do the same tasks over and over, for example, waste time with an APP that the main information is not straight to the point.
* You must incorporate the DRY principles into the rest of your life.

Obviously, not every model will fit every project, as this can be project-by-project dependent. However, I will be adding more content in the near future. You can also suggest changes by forking this repository and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people who contributed to expanding this model!

A list of people and technologies that contributed to this project is listed in the acknowledgments.
